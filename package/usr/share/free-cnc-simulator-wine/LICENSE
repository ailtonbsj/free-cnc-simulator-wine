Bulldog CncSimulator LICENSE AGREEMENT

UPON ACCEPTANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE EVALUATION LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT"), Bulldog Digital Technologies GRANTS TO THE REQUESTER A LIMITED NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO USE CNCSIMULATOR SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION (THE "SOFTWARE") AS FOLLOWS:

 

CONDITIONS:
Bulldog CncSimulator is "Returnware". We will provide you with a full sharp license for free as long as you keep coming back to our site once in a while, fair enough? When you register as a user of CncSimulator we will mail you a link to a "petrol file". It will let you use CncSimulator completely free of charge during 3 months. After this period the only thing we ask you to do is to return to our site and download a new petrol file, for another 1-3 months and so on. The file is small and can be downloaded quickly even with a slow modem. And the installation is done in seconds. By accepting this license you also give us the authority to send you email with information on updates and news about the CncSimulator and other softwares and services from Bulldog Digital Technologies (we do not share any email addresses to any third part).
 
Note that the time for a petrol file to expire may be changed in the future without further notice.
